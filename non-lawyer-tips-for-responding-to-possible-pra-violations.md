# Records denials

## Active investigation

In order to categorically deny records because of an active investigation the records must be complied by a law enforcement agency. [http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/896291.pdf](http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/896291.pdf)


"Records are essential to effective law enforcement if the investigation is leading toward an enforcement proceeding."

"In determining if an investigation is leading toward an enforcement proceeding, the federal courts examine (1) "affidavits by people with direct knowledge of and responsibility for the investigation ..."; (2) whether resources are allocated to the investigation; and (3) whether enforcement proceedings are contemplated."

# Format denials

There are agencies that deny requests for records in electronic format or in a particular format. I have found that the best way to get records such as emails in a machine readable format such as EML, PST, or MSG is to request the records with their meta-data. Printing or converting to PDF typically doesn't preserve meta-data. If a record requires redact as for the email to be edited in notepad.
