<h1>Seattle Public Records</h1>
<h3>The mission SPR</h3>
<p>SPR's mission is to work with the City of Seattle in a 60-40 relationship to automatically redact and release as many city public records as possible while protecting privacy and security and to make the records useful to the general public.</p>
<h3>Washington Public Records Act: Construction</h3>
<p>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. 
The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good 
for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed 
so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. 
This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote 
this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. 
In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, 
the provisions of this chapter shall govern.</p>
