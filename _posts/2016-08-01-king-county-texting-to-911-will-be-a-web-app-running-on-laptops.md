Below is copy/pasted from email I received under public disclosure from King County which is in charge of implementing texting to 911 county-wide including for Seattle Police and Fire. As you can see King County intends to use a web app running on a dedicated laptop. 

Hey Everyone,

I have drafted the email to go out to the PSAPs but wanted your edits befor=
e sending out. My hope it is send tomorrow afternoon so I can give them a w=
eek but if I need to I can wait and send on Monday.

So send me your edits and I will compile and send out.



Good Afternoon,

The E-911 Program Office is working through the steps to reaching the end g=
oal of implementing Text-to-911 county-wide. As we are moving through our p=
rocesses we will continue to that conversations with the IAG as well and wo=
rking with the necessary staff in the PSAPs.  At this time we have three qu=
estions that we would like you to respond to by August 1.



1.       The current plan is to implement a web based system that will be i=
nstalled on a laptop. These laptops will be bought and provisioned by the P=
rogram Office. We recommend that the large PSAPs have at least 5, and the s=
mall PSAPs have at least 2.  If you choose to start with the minimum number=
 we can add laptops as needed, or you may choose to have one laptop per cal=
l taking station.

How many laptops would your center like to have?



2.       Do you have available house jacks at each of your call taking stat=
ions?



3.       Do you have available power outlets at each of your call taking st=
ations?
