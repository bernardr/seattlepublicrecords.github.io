This is a **rumor**. Take it with a huge gain of salt. 

According to a confidential source, a person the source met claimed to be working for Taser/Axon. That person told the source that Taser/Axon got the Seattle Police contract. Various details provided to me were removed from drafts of this rumor report in consultation with the source because the source felt that the details would identify him and his source. I have filed public records requests in an effort to confirm this rumor.
