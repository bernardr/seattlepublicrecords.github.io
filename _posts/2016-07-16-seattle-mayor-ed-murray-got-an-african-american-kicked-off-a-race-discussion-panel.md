**News:** Seattle Mayor Ed Mayor got former NAACP President James Bible, an African American attorney, kicked off a race discussion panel. The reasoning had to do with an assertion that NAACP had sued or was suing the city. Bible's replacement was former King County Sheriff Sue Rahr, a Caucasian who leads the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission.

**Opinion:** WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!? Litigation is no excuse! Hell Kiro itself has sued the city over PRA cases and is a defendant in an active PRA suit involving the feds and city about survillenance cameras. If you're going to replace an African American with a Caucasian person that person should be current King County Sheriff John who fired two officers for making a false allegation that an [African American King County Metro Transit driver swore at them](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/deputy-who-accused-bus-driver-of-profanity-fired-for-dishonesty/).
