Today I started reviewing records in person at Seattle Police because I hate fees. The person assigned to making sure I didn't break anything told me she was new to the Public Disclosure Unit (PDU). So I asked the Media Unit:

"This is a media unit request:

How many new hires for PDU this year?
How many total people are assigned to PDU?
How many more new hires for PDU are expected this year?"

Jonah Spangenthal-Lee's response was: 

"PDU is hiring temporary employees (TES) to address the immediate backlog caused by the spike in the number of requests, the volume of records SPD creates, the volume of records requested, and the complexity of requests.we are receiving.

PDU has filled one position so far and is looking to hire two other TES employees (a video specialist and paralegal) to assist in PRA requests.

There are currently a total of 10 permanent and TES employees assigned to PDU."
