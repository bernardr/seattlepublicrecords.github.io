Another deadly attack on police officers in America occurred today. A lot of people have heard about the helmet that saved an Orlando officer. So what about equiping Seattle Police officers with a bullet resistant baseball cap that most people wouldn't consider "militarized"?

**Public records request:** I made a public records request on officer safety nine days ago:

This is a public records request for any emails with meta-data about
bullet proofing vehicles, increasing body armor, improving building
security, patrolling in pairs, requiring more than one officer on all
or most calls, protecting addresses of officers and their families,
protecting identities of undercover officers, protective equipment
during protests/riots. Personally I think there's a lot SPD could do
to better protect officers and hopefully the records will shed light
on why things aren't better.
