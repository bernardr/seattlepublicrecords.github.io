Meet Precious. She's super happy in this photo because Seattle Police rescued her from an allegedly frequently violent drunk homeless man who witnesses say hit her.

My buddies and I were trying to find officers who zoomed past a friend of ours when we heard over the scanner a possible help the officer call two blocks away on the side of CenturyLink Field. We came apon officers surrounding a shirtless man.

Quickly we learn this was not a real help the officer call. At the time officers believed the man claimed officers were down. In the below video the man, named John, becomes very angry and yet Officer Levitt, the one talking with him, is chill.

Long story short, officers did not want to attempt an arrest on this man for the fake help the officer call because of how much he wanted to fight officers. One of them told me they would let charges be decided by a higher unit. They stayed on scene for almost an hour letting him walk his dog hoping he would calm down. Towards the end one of my buddies witness him hit his dog but we didn't have it on video because my phone had died and they had stopped filming. A witness had also mentioned earlier that he saw the man hit his dog. About 10-20 minutes later officers left. As soon as they left, 911 received a call saying the man had driven off. Knowing he was intoxicated officers caught up to him and pulled him over. We found them administering field sobriety tests and then a field breathalyzer test. An officer told me at that scene that a dispatcher listened to his 911 call and said there was a pause that caused officers to no longer be interested in perusing a charge over the 911 call. An officer also said they had dealth with this man earlier in the night.

The man was arrested for DUI. There was no use of force. Had officers tried to arrest the man earlier, I belive use of force would have been likely. His dog Precious was transported to Seattle Animal Shelter. According to officers there's a possibility that Precious [may become available for adoption](http://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/adopt).

**Big thank you:** I sent the following to [Thank a Seattle Police employee](http://www.seattle.gov/police/recognition/thankyou.htm) All of the officers involved could not have be any nicer to me and my three buddies. They acted like we were friends and at no point did they draw attention to the cameras. Levitt lead the talking with the suspect and demonstrated extremely good deescalation skills. I have video in my article of the suspect getting extremely angry. These officers stayed on scene for about an hour ensuring that he had calmed down. Soon after they left 911 got a call that the suspect had driven off. Officers quickly found him and arrested him for DUI. By letting him cool down officers were able to make an arrest without use of force and by staying on scene were able to quickly get to him for the arrest on DUI. A fake help officer call is intense. These officers were absolutely amazing. I hope they get an award for this and that this event is shown to all current and future Seattle Police officers.

At SPR, we're (six people are already helping behind the scenes regularly) committed to **fully** informing the public about the activities of Seattle Police and all governemnt agencies operating Seattle. By providing examples of good policing we are informing the public of the good work SPD is already doing and reminding officers who make mistakes of what good policing looks like. For example just think if Officer Levitt was responding to the Alton Sterling call. Sterling very likely would be alive today based on how calm Levitt and his partners were in this instance. The video above shows that Levitt has been extremely professional with at least one African American male. Being calmed and slowing down things totally worked in the case that happened 7/13/16. And they still made an arrest. So clearly in at least some high energy events officers can calm down a suspect to the point where they can make a smooth arrest.
