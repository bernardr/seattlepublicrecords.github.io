**News:** In March, Seattle Police started using GovQA for handling public records requests. Within the last few days they started putting direct links to records. Before this change one would have to log into GovQA, search for their request, and then download the records. This not only makes it easy for the average requester but means that it will be easy to automatically download records and auto upload them to say Dropbox and Youtube (if video).

**Opnion:** I'm hopeful SPD is able to get GovQA to make records auto released after payment. Right now records officers are sometimes forgetting to charge someone and then can take hours to release the records after fee paid. Another thing that would be nice is if GovQA could remember my debit card info like my cell phone provider.
