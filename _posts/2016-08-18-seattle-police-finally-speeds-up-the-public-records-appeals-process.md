Well I'm in a good mood. Some requests of mine to Seattle Police got denied. I immediately filed an appeal. Got a response two business days later in line with the records act's timeline "Agencies [...] shall establish mechanisms for the most prompt possible review of decisions denying inspection, and such review shall be deemed completed at the end of the second business day following the denial of inspection"

I complained to SPD about its slow appeal response to in my view a totally improper denial of a video. It took around 90 days in that case for them to response to my appeal. Maybe that complaint lead to fixes. Who knows. All I know is I love quick appeal responses.
