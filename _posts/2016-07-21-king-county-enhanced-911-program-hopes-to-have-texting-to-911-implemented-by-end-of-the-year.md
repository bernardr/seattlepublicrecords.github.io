Seattle Police still doesn't have texting to 911. Seattle Police's rollout of texting to 911 is controlled by the county's Enhanced 911 Program. Kitsap and Snohomish coutnies got texting to 911 over a year ago. Clallam and Jefferson counties got it this year. While it's not clear in the below emails what the hold up is, internally the county is aiming to rollout texting to 911 by the end of the year.
