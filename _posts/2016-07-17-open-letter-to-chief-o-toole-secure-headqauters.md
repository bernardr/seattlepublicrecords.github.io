Dear Chief O'Toole:

Seattle Police headqauters is insecure. A lone officer with a handgun guarding an open enterway to elevators not requiring ID badge to floors with windows for doors is unlikely to stop the criminals/terrorists killing officers in this country. I demand, as someone who often depends on Seattle Police services as a visitor to the city, that you fix the weak protection of headquaters. 

Security is not an either or choice. Officers can have great relationships with the community AND be far more secure than they are today.

Here's my proposal:

1. Disallow entering/exiting headquaters via parking garage doors below the restricted parking floors. This is to prevent an inturder from following someone into the building or coming in as someone is leaving.
2. Switch to biometrics. RFID cards are weak sauce. Cards can be physicially stolen during an attack or cloned by attackers smart enough to follow instructions found online.
3. Live stream video of entry points to multiple 24/7 centers like SPD 911, SFD 911, Realtime Crime Center. Have video of major areas on each floor to give responders intell in an emergency. Make access control controllable by remote emergency centers so that those centers can stop say an attacker putting a gun to an employee's head to open a door.
4. Ensure all doors are "bullet proof". Get rid of all glass.
5. Replace the open hallway to elevators with a secured enterance to the hallway with a secondary door protecting staris/elevators and put access controls on the elevators.
6. Implement weapon screening. Although policy requires screening visitors for weapons I have never been screened for them. I have though at courts.
7. Train every person on what to do if they think someone is trying to get in. Put panic buttons at all enterances and give employees a number to call that if called auto dispatches responders.
8. Put medical supplies and two way video communication throughout the building. In a terrorist attack it may be difficult for first responders to immediately get to down people.
9. Have an alert system. Make sure emergency staff can rapidly detrimine who's in the building based on entry exit logs. Have a way to blast alerts to phones and communicate building wide via intercom.
10. Do drills.
