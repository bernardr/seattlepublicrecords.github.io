On Friday 8/19/16 I learned from Stranger reporter Ansel Herz that Seattle Police is working with City of Seattle Records Manager Jennifer Winkler to seek a revision to the state's retention schedule. Specifically SPD wants the State to "categorize fail-safe video as it does security video that is constantly overwritten and doesn’t need to be retained if it isn’t downloaded and used" (Seattle Police Director of Transparency and Privacy Mary Perry to Ansel Herz)

The retention schedule for security video that was sent to Herz says that security video not known to have captured an incident are to be retained until it known for sure that no incident has occured and no more than 30 days. 

The recording of pre-event video could be turned off by the department, see [Coban forum: Fail Safe not capturing correct start/end times](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mD9W1wRTUgcJ:forums.cobantech.com/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D8%26t%3D288+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). Officers/supervisors have recovered pre-event video on their own, see [OPA #2015-1868](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPA/ClosedCaseSummaries/2015-1868ccs07-06-16.pdf), [OPA #2015-0711](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPA/ClosedCaseSummaries/2015-0711ccs03-29-16.pdf), and [OPA #2015-1822](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPA/ClosedCaseSummaries/2015-1822ccs05-06-16.pdf). Instructions for doing so are on pages 21/22 of [Coban's user manual](http://www.mctx.org/departments_d-k/departments_q-z/radio_shop/docs/cobancompleteusermanual.pdf). COBAN states "The highest availability of video evidence out there: dual stream, fail-safe recording. Video is captured twice onto two independent media. We've got your back." So the removal drive would have pre-event video on it.

Proposed retention schedule in non-technical format:

Definitions:
- Event video: an event in a dashcamera system is one where the system was automatically or manually activated and where manual action is required to deactivate it.
- Pre-event video: video in the dashcamera recorded before/after the system was activated and deactivated.

If video is dual recorded to multiple drives only one version of the video needs to be retained per the schedule:

Pre-event video for forward facing camera is to be retained on the server for 14 days and destoryed if no records request made or incident likely to involve litigation or prosecution identified. To ensure that requesters have time to have their request processed I believe forward facing pre-event video needs to be retained no matter what for 14 days. This gives requesters and agencies enough time to identify a need to request fail-safe.

Pre-event video for rear camera is to be retained until officer's shift is over to give officer time to ensure that the rear camera video of a subject involved in an incident where litigation/prosecution is likely. 

Pre-event video of incident likely to involve ligitation or prosecution retain until over including appeals exhausted.
