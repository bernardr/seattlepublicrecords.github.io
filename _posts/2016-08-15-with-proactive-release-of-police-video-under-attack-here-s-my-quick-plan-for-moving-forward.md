**Note:** I'm on a work trip so I have less time for the fun stuff like working on Seattle Public Records. This is a quickly written post. 

Spokane Police has found itself in a bit of controversy, see [Spokane police share body camera footage of ‘disorderly’ man, raising questions](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/aug/12/body-cam-footage-of-downtown-spokane-tirade-calls-/) 

I took down most videos on my policevideorequests account down to honor [Youtube's privacy policy](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines) My plan is for moving forward is to fix issues with precise auto over-redaction code I've written and then use it to republish videos I obtained via the public records act. For ICV see below:

I attempted to clone [Utility, Inc's color range approach to auto redaction of body worn video](http://www.bodyworn.com/smartredaction/) The hard part is auto determining the color ranges to redact.

From a policy standpoint I will advocate that departments mass release via automatic means redacted video. This addresses concerns that an agency is singling out a given person.
