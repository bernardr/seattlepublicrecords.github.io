Last August, SPD Officer Charles Foreman headed north for a trip to Whistler, British Columbia. During his vacation, Foreman got himself arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and charged with public intoxication, for which he paid a $115(Canadian) fine.

According to a report submitted by RCMP, Foreman also “caused a disturbance, resisted arrest, threatened officers and urinated on public property.” [OPA case summary] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/ce22tqvm92x6ua7/2015OPA-1138__Case_Summary.pdf?dl=0)

Around 12:30 a.m., Foreman was refused entry to Moe Joe’s nightclub on the grounds that he was amply intoxicated. He initiated a physical confrontation with the bouncer who was escorting him out of the club. Two RCMP constables who were on foot patrol nearby noticed the commotion and proceeded to intervene.  

“Who the fuck are you?" Foreman spat at the officer. 

“Yeah, well I’m a police officer too,” he slurred when the constable identified himself. 

From there, RCMP officers determined that Foreman was publicly drunk and causing a disturbance, and they made the decision to detain and arrest him. In interviews with OPA, the RCMP officers stated that Foreman was both actively and passively resistant during his arrest, and that he mentioned repeatedly his affiliation with SPD in what the officers believed to be an attempt to gain favor or avoid arrest. [Carlucci interview]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/7yqqbqd8kpupsk3/2015OPA-1138_Christopher_Carlucci_interview.pdf?dl=0)  Foreman resisted so forcefully that three people were required to place him in handcuffs, including the two constables and the bouncer from the nightclub he had been attempting to enter.

During transport, RCMP reports that Foreman asked the officers to disable the in-car recording device. Constable Carlucci of RCMP stated that he “started to ignore Foreman, [believing] he was going to try to bargain or ask for favor or immunity.” 
(*Note: RCMP does not equip its patrol cars with in-car recording devices.)

While Foreman was being booked into jail, he continued to be confrontational with the RCMP officers. Again addressing Carlucci, Foreman peppered him with what Carlucci described as “provoking” questions: did he ever travel to Seattle? Was he planning to travel to Seattle?

“I hope to see you in Seattle, Carlucci” Foreman said, reading the name on the officer’s uniform. 

When asked about this comment in an interview with OPA, Carlucci responded that he “certainly” perceived the comment as threatening. 

“I didn’t take it as a direct threat,” he said, noting that he believed it would be impossible for Foreman to feasibly track him down if he were ever in Seattle.

“But I took it more as secondary evidence of his demeanor [and] the way he was acting toward us as police officers.” 

Foreman spent the night in a Whistler jail getting sober. During his stay at the jail, he urinated on a wall despite the presence of a fully functioning toilet in his cell. He was released the next morning and charged with public intoxication. Since it's common practice for departments to notify the affiliated departments anytime an officer is arrested, Foreman's chain of command at SPD was contacted while he was still in custody.

When asked by OPA about his behavior officer foreman claimed that he doesn't remember anything about the incident. 
According to [SPD manual](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wauol7xgfx7uzh7/5001_S_D_%28effective_4-1-2015%29.pdf?dl=0 5.001), Regardless of duty status, employees may not engage in behavior that undermines public trust in the department, the officer, or other officers. OPA determined that Foreman’s behavior in Whistler violated this policy standard. OPA imposed a [five day suspension]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/ecmapfakvd58q89/2015-1138__Final_DAR_Packet.pdf?dl=0), for which Foreman made, and had signed by supervisor [Lt. Scott Moss](https://seattlepublicrecords.org/information/agencies/city_of_seattle/seattle_police_department/copbook/6026/) a request to use his [vacation days]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/wtjgab6cb43hp54/2015-1138__SIgned_Receipt__Final_DAR.pdf?dl=0).
