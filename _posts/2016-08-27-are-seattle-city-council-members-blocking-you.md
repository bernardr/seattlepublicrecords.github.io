Bretthamil made one claim in the beginning of his article that we did a little digging on, particularly, whether or not Seattle City Council Members were out on social media blocking people in lieu of their particular policy stances.  To do this we did a public records request for the list of blocked users for each Seattle City Council Member Twitter and Facebook accounts.  Thus far, we have only received info on two council members with a promise that the rest will be coming quickly due to the simplicity of the request.  Unfortunately the two council member’s that we received info thus far were not the two member’s mentioned in Brethamil’s article (Juarez and Gonzalez).  We do have evidence that Councilmembers Herbold and Johnson have collectively only blocked one individual: Councilmember Johnson blocked Ngan Posada on Facebook.  We will update this page if/when we get info on everyone else in the council.
