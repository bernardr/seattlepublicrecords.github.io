In [Seattle Police refuse to release a special type of in-car video called Fail-safe video](https://seattlepublicrecords.org/news/seattle-police-refuse-to-release-a-special-type-of-in-car-video-called-fail-safe-video) I explained that Seattle Police refuses to release to me and others police dashcam fail-safe videos of specific incidents complained about on Twitter. Now the Washington State Archive is saying all police dashcam fail-safe video must be retained for 90 days.
