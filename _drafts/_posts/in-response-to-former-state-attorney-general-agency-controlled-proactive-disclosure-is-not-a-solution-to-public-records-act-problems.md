Former State Attorney Rob Mckenna wrote in [Records law is about your right to know how officials use your money and authority](https://smartergovernmentwa.org/records-law-is-about-your-right-to-know-how-officials-use-your-money-and-authority/) "A more radical solution, but one that might be more useful in the long term: Store many more government documents online, allowing the public to search for the information they want. Some cities already do this with, for instance, city councilmember emails. Agencies can start by posting the most commonly requested info; it will cut down on duplication of work and reduce time spent by staff on requests."

I believe most of the time major proactive disclosure projects cost way more money than they should and generate more records requests. The real cost in my opinion with proactive disclosure is all the meetings that take place to decide what will and won't be posted, often far less than what's available via the act.

In my opinion the public records act has two fundamental problems it doesn't achive enough transparency and doesn't protect the common definition of citizen privacy.
