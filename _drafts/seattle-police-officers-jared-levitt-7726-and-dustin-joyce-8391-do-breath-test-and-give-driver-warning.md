On August, 30, 2016 around 8:50 PM Seattle Police West Precinct Mary Sector Officers Jared Levitt #7726 and Dustin Joyce #8391 pulled over a driver for expired tabs. Officer Levitt asked the driver to step out of the vehicle to do field soberity tests. Levitt first assessed what the driver's normal compentency was. Then he explained that the driver could just do a breath test to speed up the process. The driver did and about five minutes late Levitt him a warning. Watching this in person I learned that warnings are still done via paper wasting about five to ten minutes of writing a warning on paper. Regular traffic citations are done electronically.
