I think it's important that the public be informed about expertly handled police interactions so that it can point to expertly handled situations when similar situations aren't handled well and to praise the officers for a job well done. The following account is an example of an expertly handled arrest situation where my gut feeling was I was about to witness the man be slammed to the ground. If Seattle Police officers in the future slam a black high man with felony warrant to the ground I promise you that this post will be referenced.
