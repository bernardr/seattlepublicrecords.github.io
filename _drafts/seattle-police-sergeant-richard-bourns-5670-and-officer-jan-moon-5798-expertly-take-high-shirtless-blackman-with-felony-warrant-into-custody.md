I think it's important that the public be informed about expertly handled police interactions so that it can point to expertly handled situations when similar situations aren't handled well and to praise the officers for a job well done. The following account is an example of an expertly handled arrest situation where my gut feeling was I was about to witness the man be slammed to the ground. If Seattle Police officers in the future slam a black high man with felony warrant to the ground I promise you that me or someone else at SPR will reference this post.

<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
On 08/03/16, at approximately 2311 hours, officers responded to two males physically          in front of        Ave. One of the males was described as a black male with no shirt and black shorts. Officers arrived shortly thereafter and observed the black male with no shirt, later identified as         , following an unknown black male in the area of   Ave and Lenora St. The unknown black male, flagged down officers     asked for assistance because          was following him. Officers subsequently contacted          at the intersection of   Ave and Lenora St. was very fidgeting moving back and forth and was sweating profusely. I asked          if he had been using narcotics to which he did not reply. I then told         , who was now standing in the intersection with a green light northbound, to walk over to the patrol vehicle. Upon trying to escort         , he immediately pulled his right arm away. A moment later,          gritted his teeth and moved his head quickly towards my chest stated something like, "Leave me alone." Officers subsequently grabbed each of         's arms and escorted him to the patrol vehicle. I repeatedly told          to calm down and relax and that we did not want to fight him.         's muscles were tense, but          complied and did not fight with officers. A name check revealed that          had a felony warrant for possession of a firearm out of    .   . and a SMC misdemeanor warrant for obstruction. Both warrants were verified and          was transported to    .   . Jail via AMR and 3-Mary-3.         's name check further revealed that          has a long history of violence towards officers including threatening to kill police officers while armed with a knife. After the incident, officers discovered that the unknown male had left the scene.
